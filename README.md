# Bachelor's Thesis
This is an application created as a part of my Bachelor's Thesis. Its purpose is to be used by students of the course English 
for IT to test themselves and learn the vocabulary of the IT field in Czech and English languages. When I started developing it 
I knew very little of JavaFX or SQL so I understand that there are certain errors or bad programming practices. Despite this fact 
I've decided to share the source code as it serves me as a reminder of how I improved during its development.
